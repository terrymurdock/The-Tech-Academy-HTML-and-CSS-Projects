		<p>Some interesting information about dogs from Simple English Wikipedia:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">
		Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. There are different studies that suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before our time. The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of Australia).
